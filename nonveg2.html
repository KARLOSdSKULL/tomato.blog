                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Chicken Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish made with basmati rice, marinated chicken, and a blend of spices. It is believed to have originated in the kitchens of the Mughal Emperors in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
                <p>The dish combines elements of Indian and Persian cuisine, with its roots tracing back to the royal kitchens where it was prepared as a symbol of hospitality and celebration. Over time, Chicken Biryani has evolved into various regional styles, each with its own unique blend of spices and cooking techniques.</p>
                
                <h3>How It's Made</h3>
                <p>The preparation of Chicken Biryani involves marinating chicken pieces in a mixture of yogurt and spices, including garam masala, turmeric, and chili powder. The marinated chicken is then layered with partially cooked basmati rice and caramelized onions in a heavy-bottomed pot.</p>
                <p>Saffron-infused milk, mint leaves, and fried onions are added to enhance the aroma and flavor of the dish. The pot is sealed with a tight-fitting lid and cooked on low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together and the rice to absorb the fragrant steam.</p>
