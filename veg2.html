                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Veg Biryani is a fragrant rice dish infused with aromatic spices and mixed vegetables. Originating from the Indian subcontinent, Biryani is renowned for its delicious blend of flavors and textures, making it a favorite choice for both casual meals and special occasions.</p>
                <p>The dish is believed to have evolved from Persian influences on Indian cuisine, particularly during the Mughal era. Over time, it has adapted and diversified into various regional variations, each offering its own unique twist on this classic rice preparation.</p>
                
                <h3>How It's Made</h3>
                <p>Veg Biryani preparation involves cooking basmati rice and vegetables separately, then layering them with aromatic spices like saffron, cloves, and cardamom.

                <p>Key to the dish's success is the quality of rice, spices, and vegetables used. Each component must be of high quality to ensure the Biryani achieves its signature taste and aroma.</p>
