                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Butter Chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a popular Indian dish known for its creamy texture and rich flavors. It originated in Delhi, India, in the 1950s, at the famous Moti Mahal restaurant.</p>
                <p>The dish was created by combining leftover tandoori chicken pieces with a tomato-based gravy, enriched with butter, cream, and various spices. It was an instant hit and has since become a staple in Indian restaurants worldwide.</p>
                
                <h3>How It's Made</h3>
                <p>Traditionally, Butter Chicken starts with marinating chicken overnight in a mix of yogurt and spices. The marinated chicken is then cooked in a tandoor (clay oven) until charred and tender. The gravy is made by simmering tomatoes, butter, cream, and spices until it thickens. The tandoori chicken pieces are then added to the gravy and simmered until they absorb the flavors.</p>
                <p>The use of fresh cream and butter gives the dish its signature creamy texture, while spices such as garam masala, kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), and red chili powder provide a balanced warmth and depth of flavor.</p>
